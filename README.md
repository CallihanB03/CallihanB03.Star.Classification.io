# Star Classification

The purpose of this project is to classify star's into the following classes:
* Red Dwarf
* Brown Dwarf
* White Dwarf
* Main Sequence
* Super Giants
* Hyper Giants

This is done using different classification algorithms available through the Scikit Learn and TensorFlow Keras libraries.

The models use the following input parameters.
* Absolute Temperature (k)
* Relative Luminosity (L/Lo)
* Relative Radius (R/Ro)
* Absolute Magnitude (Mv)
* Star Color: White, Blue, Red, Yellow, etc.
* Spectral Class (O, B, A, F, K, M)
